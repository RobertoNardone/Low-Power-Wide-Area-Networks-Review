The use of GPS receivers in IVHS applications is becoming more attractive as the system nears its expected 1993 operational status and as the cost of receivers continues to drop. Other terrestrial applications are beyond the development stage, particularly in the area of automatic vehicle location and monitoring where the use of radionavigation systems has experienced tremendous growth. The federal radionavigation planning process could have significant impact upon IVHS development. The Department of Transportation's Navigation Council formulates radionavigation system policy recommendations in concert with the Department of Defense, and the resulting policy is published in biennial editions of the Federal Radionavigation Plan (FRP). Increasing emphasis is being given in the FRP to terrestrial applications, and the DOT Navigation Council is being expanded to afford full representation to the modal administrations having responsibility for land transportation.","","","10.1109/VNIS.1991.205807","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1623671","","Land transportation;Radio navigation;Global Positioning System;Councils;Fiber reinforced plastics;Intelligent vehicles;Road transportation;Costs;Computerized monitoring;Process planning","","","","","7","","9 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, it contributes to increase the survival rate of crab and achieve higher yield of soft shell crab. Our proposed system uses a LoRa-based wireless sensor network and a lightweight Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol for exchanging messages between small embedded devices, mobile devices, and sensors. The system mainly consists of sensor node as publishers, and Raspberry pi MQTT broker, and mobile client devices as subscribers. The sensor nodes are built with small embedded devices, LoRa wireless interface, and water quality sensors, i.e. water temperature sensor, pH sensor, and salinity sensor.

In parallel, IoT applications will cover a wide range of human and life needs from smart environments (cities, home, transportation, etc.) to health and quality of life. Among these popular LPWANs technologies, we have identified the unlicensed frequency band (LoRa, DASH7, SigFox, Wi-SUN, etc.), and the licensed frequency band standards (NB-IoT, LTE Cat-M, EC-GSM-IoT, etc.). In general, both types of standards only consider fixed interconnected things, and less attention has been provided to the mobility of the things or devices. In this paper, we address the mobility of the things and the connectivity in each of the three LPWAN standards: LoRaWAN, DASH7, and NB-IoT. In particular, we show how the mobility of things can be achieved when transmitting and receiving data. Then, we provide a general and technical comparison for the three standards.

These applications consist of smart building automation systems, healthcare monitoring systems, and intelligent and connected transportation, among others. The integration of IoT-based vehicular technologies will enrich services that are eventually going to ignite the proliferation of exciting and even more advanced technological marvels. However, depending on different requirements and design models for networking and architecture, such integration needs the development of newer communication architectures and frameworks. This work proposes a novel framework for architectural and communication design to effectively integrate vehicular networking clouds with IoT, referred to as VCoT, to materialize new applications that provision various IoT services through vehicular clouds. In this article, we particularly put emphasis on smart city applications deployed, operated, and controlled through LoRaWAN-based vehicular networks. LoraWAN, being a new technology, provides efficient and long-range communication possibilities. The article also discusses possible research issues in such an integration including data aggregation, security, privacy, data quality, and network coverage. These issues must be addressed in order to realize the VCoT paradigm deployment, and to provide insights for investors and key stakeholders in VCoT service provisioning. The article presents deep insights for different real-world application scenarios (i.e., smart homes, intelligent traffic light, and smart city) using VCoT for general control and automation along with their associated challenges. It also presents initial insights, through preliminary results, regarding data and resource management in IoT-based resource constrained environments through vehicular clouds.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.2019.1800236","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8675174","","Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Smart cities;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Logic gates;Computer architecture","cloud computing;health care;Internet of Things;mobile radio;vehicular ad hoc networks;wide area networks","smart city services;vehicular ad hoc networks;cloud computing;Internet of Things;smart urban spaces;smart building automation systems;healthcare monitoring systems;intelligent transportation;IoT-based vehicular technologies;architectural communication design;vehicular networking clouds;smart city applications;LoRaWAN-based vehicular networks;VCoT paradigm deployment;VCoT service provisioning;real-world application scenarios;smart homes;IoT-based resource constrained environments;vehicular clouds;communication architectures;long-range communication;data aggregation;intelligent traffic light;smart city","","13","15","","27 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

These measures are paramount to ensure that the supply of food and agricultural products can withstand the increasing amount of demand from the increasing population. As computers continue to improve, the advent of applying the powers of the IoT in farming is within grasp. The research revolves around the framework and design of an internet enabled modular farming system that addresses the need for people to tend heavily on their growing crops. A network controls different components and continuously gathers data while transceiving with users. The setup, ideally situated in non-agricultural lands such as residential and commercial areas enable the person in charge to accomplish other tasks and leave the system to tend to the crops. The system will control factors such as temperature, light, relative humidity, and nutrient concentration in the water for the crops to grow under ideal conditions. The group believes that this will bring the farming into a new level, allowing every consumer to have their own vertical farming set-up in their own households without worrying about it thus eliminating their need to rely on food manufacturers. In addition, growing edible plants in Metro Manila would make them more easily accessible and can be served fresh to consumers, more frequently, without the added cost of transportation and various chemicals.","","978-1-5386-7767-4","10.1109/HNICEM.2018.8666382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666382","aeroponics;Internet of Things;precision agriculture;vertical farming","Temperature sensors;Agriculture;Humidity;Internet of Things;Monitoring;Sociology","crops;farming;food products;Internet of Things","network connected modular environmental chambers;nonagricultural lands;food manufacturers;Internet of things;agricultural product;farming system;crop growing;smart aeroponic tailored model;food product supply;network controls;Metro Manila;transportation cost","","1","7","","14 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Technology that can detect and mitigate distraction by alerting distracted drivers could play a central role in maintaining safety. Based on either eye measures or driver performance measures, numerous algorithms to detect distraction have been developed. Combining both eye glance and vehicle data could enhance distraction detection. The goal of this paper is to evaluate whether changes in the eye-steering correlation structure can indicate distraction. Drivers performed visual, cognitive, and cognitive/visual tasks while driving in a simulator. The auto- and cross-correlations of horizontal eye position and steering wheel angle show that eye movements associated with road scanning produce a low eye-steering correlation. However, even this weak correlation is sensitive to distraction. Time lead associated with the maximum correlation is sensitive to all three types of distraction, and the maximum correlation coefficient is most strongly affected by off-road glances. These results demonstrate that eye-steering correlation statistics can detect distraction and differentiate between types of distraction.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2012.2208223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6270003","Driver distraction;driving performance;eye movement;eye–steering coordination;secondary task;time series analysis","Vehicles;Visualization;Correlation;Roads;Wheels;Vehicle crash testing;Tracking","road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;steering systems","steering movements;eye movements;driver distraction;driver performance;vehicle data;eye glance;distraction detection enhancement;eye steering correlation structure;horizontal eye position;road scanning","","18","49","","16 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In comparison to expensive, huge, complex, proprietary, cloud dependent, often manual, and very energy hungry industrial solutions out on the market, Hydro-System Automation (HA) is a cheaper, smaller, simpler, modular, smart, and sustainable Hydro-System. The design entails sensing and actuating units as well as a wireless communications subsystem between said units. The Sensing Units (SU)s are composed of cheaper, smaller, simpler, and more sustainable sensors, micro-controllers, electronics, solar panels, and batteries than those used in current industrial solutions available. Future SUs will be packaged in 3D-printed casings which are cheaper to produce, can be custom fabricated to incorporate specific designs, fit in tight spots, and meet a variety of environments, installation requirements, and quality standards. The Actuating Units (AU)s are composed of automated pumping and/or valve stations which are powered via solar panels. The wireless communications sub-system is responsible for maintaining the overall cohesion of the system via a custom routing protocol atop a transport layer such as LoRa and a wireless physical layer utilizing RFM95 Radio Modules in the 915/916 MHz frequency band.

On one hand, smart cities cover several domains, such smart gird, smart transportation, smart building/homes, etc. On the other hand, the communications layer to support all the traffic generated by smart applications must have a large coverage, guarantee a given quality of service, cope with strongly heterogeneous traffic, low-cost, low power consumption, etc. Recently, different wireless/mobile technologies are proposed for the connectivity of IoT sensors/actuators in the smart city and to fulfil the cited requirements. This new wave of technologies is referred as “Low-Power Wide Area” (LPWA) wireless networks, which is represented by solutions like LoRa, SigFox, Narrowband IoT Long Term Evolution (NB-IoT LTE), etc. In this work, we make a performance evaluation of the LoRa system in connecting applications of smart distribution grid, as a part of smart cities; with main focus on smart metering.","","978-1-5386-7330-0","10.1109/WINCOM.2018.8629693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8629693","Internet-of-Things;LoRA;LPWA;Smart cities;Smart distribution grid;Smart metering","Smart cities;Smart grids;Smart meters;Internet of Things;Long Term Evolution;Performance evaluation","building management systems;home automation;Internet;Internet of Things;Long Term Evolution;smart power grids;telecommunication traffic;wide area networks","smart city;smart gird;smart transportation;smart applications;low power consumption;smart distribution grid;smart metering;future cities;smart building;low-power wide area;smart homes;LoRa system;Internet-of-Thing paradigm;ICT platform","","1","20","","31 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using the emerging LoRaWAN and Sigfox networks (as examples of Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology), we investigate the opportunity to locate and recover delivery drones that have crashed either due to technical issues or outside malign intervention. Location and recovery of a test drone using LoRa technology was trialed over three distinct terrains (urban, suburban, and rural) at five different sites in each terrain. These 15 trials evaluate ease of recovery on arrival at the crash site, accuracy of location coordinates given, and a subsequent analysis of the channel statistics for the LoRa network. The experiment was repeated using the Sigfox network as a comparison. The drone was able to be recovered at 14 of the 15 tests sites for both LoRa and Sigfox; in every case the drone's location was successfully transmitted to the secure server via the LPWAN networks. The paper investigates the reported location accuracy from the drone and also uses RMSE as an accuracy metric. The paper furthermore divulges lessons learned and presents a drone recovery algorithm.","1941-1197","","10.1109/MITS.2019.2898972","InvestNI; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8686338","","Drones;Global Positioning System;Payloads;Companies;Loss measurement;Base stations;Internet of Things","Internet of Things;mobile radio;remotely operated vehicles;telecommunication power management;wide area networks;wireless channels","LoRa network;Sigfox network;LPWAN networks;location accuracy;drone recovery algorithm;LPWAN technology;Low Power Wide Area Network;delivery drones","","","70","","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

For this reason, the challenge of providing energy-efficient, reliable, secure, and variable devices with ubiquitous connectivity cannot be addressed by any single Radio Access Technology (RAT) available today. Therefore, the concept of multi-RAT devices in the context of next-generation communication technologies (5G and beyond 5G (B5G)) comes into play. In this paper, we investigate the utility of multi-RAT IoT connectivity in practice with respect to a Smart City scenario, in which the location of public transport vehicles e.g., trams and buses is tracked and reported by a device equipped with two Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies i.e., Narrowband IoT (3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)) and LoRaWAN (non-3GPP). Both technologies got matured and have shown their momentum in the recent years, and are expected to play the key role also in the future. We first detail the constructed multi-RAT prototype and then report the initial results of its evaluation in a pilot deployment in the city of Brno, Czech Republic. The obtained results illustratively confirm the feasibility of joint usage of two diverse LPWAN RATs while their combination brings higher flexibility, reliability, and improve the overall Quality of Service (QoS) to wireless connectivity.","","978-1-7281-6047-4","10.1109/6GSUMMIT49458.2020.9083791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9083791","","","5G mobile communication;Internet of Things;radio access networks;smart cities;wide area networks","enable mMTC applications;wireless communication technology;massive machine-type communication;ubiquitous connectivity;radio access technology;multiRAT devices;next-generation communication technologies;multiRAT IoT connectivity;smart city scenario;low-power wide-area network technologies;narrowband IoT;non3GPP;constructed multiRAT prototype;wireless connectivity;diverse LPWAN RAT;public transport vehicles;multiradio communication technologie;B5G networks;low-power wide-area network;3rd Generation Partnership Project;LoRaWAN;Brno;Czech Republic;quality of service;QoS","","","13","","4 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the communication infrastructure in confined spaces is the most critical element in the smart system operation. This is especially true due to the limitations and complications of physical phenomena affecting the wireless system and networks in the mines and tunnels. Strong multipath nature of the wireless channel affects the smart wireless communication significantly in underground mine.

These specifications are formalized into a hierarchy of assume-guarantee contracts. Each contract specifies a set of temporal behaviors, characterizing the different machines composing the production line, their actions and interaction. Then, the formal specifications provided by the contracts are systematically synthesized to automatically generate a digital twin for the production line.

The maximum payload size of a LoRaWAN packet is very short and is only 50 bytes. Thus, currently TCP/IP packets cannot be transmitted over a LoRaWAN network and a network manager cannot use common commands such as telnet or ssh to remotely log into a LoRaWAN device to troubleshoot it through its LoRaWAN network. Instead, the network manager needs to go to the remote site in person to do the troubleshooting work, which incurs a great amount of time, efforts, and costs. In this paper, we design and implement a system to transmit TCP/IP packets over a LoRaWAN network.

By providing a complete IoT based system, the process of tracking, collecting, and managing the solid waste can be easily automated and monitored efficiently. By taking the example of the solid waste management crisis of Bengaluru city, India, we have come up with the overall system architecture and protocol stack to give a IoT based solution to improve the reliability and efficiency of the system. By making use of sensors, we collect data from the garbage bins and send them to a gateway using LoRa technology. The data from various garbage bins are collected by the gateway and sent to the cloud over the Internet using the MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) protocol. The main advantage of the proposed system is the use of LoRa technology for data communication which enables long distance data transmission along with low power consumption as compared to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or Zigbee.","2325-9418","978-1-5090-3646-2","10.1109/INDICON.2016.7839147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839147","IoT;LoRa;Solid Waste Management;Smart City;MQTT;Cloud;Data Analytics","","cloud computing;Internet of Things;network servers;refuse disposal;smart cities;transport protocols","IoT-based solid waste management system;smart city application;Internet of Things;IoT based architectural solution;solid waste tracking;solid waste collection;Bengaluru city;India;protocol stack;garbage bins;gateways;LoRa technology;cloud computing;MQTT protocol;Message Queue Telemetry Transport protocol;data communication;long-distance data transmission","","18","12","","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the most promising wireless communication technologies for the CPS is LoRaWAN, which enables long range transmission with low power consumption. Typical application scenarios include smart-homes, smart-cities, precision agriculture, and intelligent transportation. On the software side, novel paradigms are emerging to dominate the complexity introduced by the CPS with a large number of spatially distributed devices. Among them, aggregate computing is gaining traction, for it enables expressing the behavior of aggregates of devices by considering their ensemble as a single computational entity, allowing expressive space-time computations. In this paper, we introduce a software architecture which allows aggregate programming software to execute on a network of LoRa-communicating devices. We also provide an open source prototype implementing such architecture, which we use to study the current limitations of existing aggregate programming interpreters in resource-constrained scenarios. We conclude by drawing recommendations for developing such interpreters in order to pave the way to a more power- and data-efficient design.","","978-1-5386-4920-6","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2018.8644518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644518","","Aggregates;Programming;Servers;Software;Downlink;Protocols;Computer architecture","cyber-physical systems;distributed programming;public domain software;software architecture;software engineering;wide area networks","aggregate computing;software architecture;aggregate programming software;LoRa-communicating devices;aggregate programming interpreters;distributed programming paradigm;cyber-physical systems;LoRaWAN;open systems;software engineering;long range transmission;low power consumption;precision agriculture;spatially distributed devices;space-time computations;open source;wireless communication;smart-homes;smart-cities;intelligent transportation;resource-constrained scenarios","","","23","","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing approaches transmit an image in a sequence of packets each of which is individually acknowledged. This approach results in a long image transmission time due to the time spent waiting for the many individual acknowledgements. The acknowledgement traffic also inflates network load. To facilitate LoRa-based image transmission in agricultural monitoring IoT systems, this paper proposes a new reliable delivery protocol, Multi-Packet LoRa (MPLR), for transmission of large messages, such as images, in LoRa networks. The proposed protocol is implemented and evaluated using a LoRa testbed network. In point-to-point experiments with a single sender/receiver pair, MPLR reduced image transmission time by an average of 24% in scenarios with no packet loss, and by averages of 30%, 42%, and 49% in scenarios with 2%, 5%, and 10% loss rate, respectively. When multiple LoRa nodes send images to a single gateway, high channel utilization and an unacceptable collision probability can be experienced with the standard LoRa MAC ALOHA protocol. In experiments with between 5 and 20 nodes, MPLR in conjunction with a channel reservation protocol can successfully send more images and reduce the maximum successful image transmission time between 2 and 7 times, compared to stop-and-wait packet transmission with ALOHA.","","978-1-7281-2980-8","10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8875321","LoRa, Wireless Sensor Network, Internet of Things, reliable transport, agricultural IoT systems","Protocols;Image communication;Internet of Things;Monitoring;Payloads;Reliability;Logic gates","agriculture;image sequences;Internet of Things;protocols;telecommunication network reliability;visual communication","stop-wait packet transmission;MultiPacket LoRa;reliable delivery protocol;LoRa-based image transmission;network load;acknowledgement traffic;individual acknowledgements;long image transmission time;payload size;IoT monitoring systems;agricultural monitoring IoT systems;LoRa technology;maximum successful image transmission time;channel reservation protocol;standard LoRa MAC ALOHA protocol;packet loss;MPLR;LoRa networks","","","19","","21 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we conducted a simulation of LoRa technology using NS3 simulator in smart city scenario. Our simulations using NS3 is carried out to observe the characteristic of LoRA's transmission behavior and the radius coverage for understanding the performance limitation. The simulations show that higher Spreading Factor allows a higher packet success rate and time on air packet. Increasing the radius of gateway to the end device will reduce the packet success rate transmission. The best packet success rate value at the radius 6500 meters is 0.932 with the amount of End Node are 850.","2572-7621","978-1-7281-0834-6","10.1109/R10-HTC47129.2019.9042485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9042485","LoRA/LoraWAN;LpwAN;NS3;Smart City","","computer network performance evaluation;Internet of Things;internetworking;packet radio networks;wide area networks","IoT application;NS3 simulator;industrialized technology;LoRaWAN network architecture;market deployment;LPWAN IoT;radius coverage;spreading factor;packet success rate transmission;packet success rate value;LoRA transmission behavior;Internet of Things;gateway;LoRa characteristics analysis","","","15","","19 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
